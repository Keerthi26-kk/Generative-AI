Real-Time Fraud Detection System Using Streaming Data

Cloud-Aligned | MLOps-Ready | Jupyter Notebook Deployment

Overview

This project simulates a real-time fraud detection pipeline for financial transactions using machine learning and streaming data simulation. It is built entirely within a Jupyter Notebook environment, designed to be cloud-compatible and aligned with MLOps best practices.

The system detects anomalies in transaction data using an unsupervised learning model and mimics real-time processing to replicate how a fraud detection system would behave in a cloud production environment — making it a strong showcase for cloud-first, enterprise-level use cases.

Key Features

• Real-Time Transaction Processing
Simulates live stream processing of transactions using a time delay loop.
• Machine Learning Powered
Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm for unsupervised fraud detection.
• Cloud & MLOps Aligned
Although run locally, the system architecture supports cloud-native patterns (e.g., AWS S3, Lambda-compatible model storage, and API integration).
• Audit Logging
Detected frauds are logged with timestamps for further analysis.
• Model Monitoring & Retraining Ready
Framework supports data drift detection, periodic retraining, and performance evaluation.
• Explainable AI
Integration with SHAP allows visualization of why specific transactions were flagged.
• Scalable & Modular Design
The notebook is structured in modular cells, making it easy to extend into a fully deployed cloud-based pipeline when needed.

Tech Stack

∙Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Matplotlib)
∙Jupyter Notebook (for simulation and execution)
∙Joblib (for model persistence)
∙Simulated Streaming (using time.sleep() to replicate real-time data flow)
∙Use Case Relevance

This system is relevant for:

Financial Institutions
E-Commerce Platforms 
Payment Gateways
Any service handling large-scale financial transactions needing real-time fraud prevention

Future Enhancements

Integration with AWS S3, Lambda, and Kinesis for real deployment
Real-time dashboards using Streamlit or Dash
CI/CD pipelines for model versioning and deployment
Integration with alerting systems (Email, Slack)
